Dear Dr. Scienceman,

I am writing in response to your recent grant proposal. I would like to emphasize that our organization provides funding for experiments that seek the betterment of humanity as a whole. After reading your proposal, I am at a loss as to how you think your proposed experiments would work towards this goal in any way.

And so, I regret to inform you that your that your grant proposal to "Bring Back Crazy Experiments on Monkeys" has been rejected.

I have returned your proposal to you along with this letter. I suggest you destroy it and never show it to anyone again. These ideas are truly horrible, and I hope you do not pursue them any further.

*PROPOSAL:* Bring Back Crazy Experiments on Monkeys

*DETAILS:* Science is getting quite boring these days, so we need to go back to doing crazy things to monkeys, the time when science was fun. I, Dr, Scienceman, have several experiments in mind that I am seeking funding for.

—

*EXPERIMENT IDEA:* Love vs. Hate

*METHODOLOGY:* Teach one monkey to love, and another monkey to hate. Then see which monkey wins in a fight.

*GOAL:* This experiment will finally answer the question, which is better, loving or hating?

—

*EXPERIMENT IDEA:* Robot child

*METHODOLOGY:* We all know the classic Nature vs. Nurture experiment where one making was raised by a nice mother, and another by a spiky robot mother. In this experiment, a monkey will raise a spiky robot child and we'll see what that's like.

*GOAL:* It would be very interesting to see a monkey team up with a spiky robot. This experiment could end up with a cool movie being made about the antics the monkey and robot will inevitably get into.

—

*EXPERIMENT IDEA:* Can a monkey out-drink me?

*METHODOLOGY:* I buy two cases of beer, one for me and one for the monkey. Then we go to toe to toe seeing who can drink the most the fastest.

*PURPOSE:* This experiment is just a good time for the monkey and I. I guess it would also determine how cool a monkey could be at a party.

*EXPERIMENT IDEA:* Make a monkey with big ol’ claws

*METHODOLOGY:* This one is simple. We use science to breed a monkey with big ol’ claws.

*PURPOSE:* Stopping Crime

—

*EXPERIMENT IDEA:* How Pretty can a Monkey Be?

*METHODOLOGY:* We get a monkey and make it as pretty as possible. Like we give it lipstick and makeup and a dress. Then we send it to a speed dating session and see if it can get anyone's number.

*PURPOSE:* I'm pretty sure no matter how pretty you try to make a monkey, you'll still be able to tell it's a monkey. This experiment will help us figure out how many weirdos out there will try to date a monkey.

*EXPERIMENT IDEA:* Elongated Monkey

*METHODOLOGY:* We'll put a monkey on one of those stretcher things they tortured people with in medieval times. But we won't torture the monkey—we'll just stretch it a little bit at a time to make it longer and longer.

*PURPOSE:* I want to see how long a monkey can get. It will also help the monkey reach bananas at the  top of the tree. It's really a win-win. I get to see a long monkey, and it doesn't have to fight over low-hanging fruit.

*EXPERIMENT IDEA:* Monkey Electricity

*METHODOLOGY:* In this experiment, we'll give a monkey a kite with a key on it and send it out in a thunderstorm, Benjamin Franklin style. Then we will see if it invents the lightbulb.

*PURPOSE:* If the monkey can figure out electricity, man that’d be cool. The purpose of this is to get monkeys interested in science so they can do experiments for us.
