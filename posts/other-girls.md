I just can’t get her out of my mind. It’s this girl in my lecture, and she’s the best. There’s just something about her. I like how she isn’t like other girls. You know how other girls are–going out with their friends, joining sororities, getting coffee.

Well, not this girl. Nope, she’s the kind of girl who would rather sit in the library wearing a long dress with a bonnet, eating saltines while she reads a book by candlelight. I don’t even know if they’re saltines. I think it’s just some small pieces of stale bread she eats. She’s so different!

She’s got a good head on her shoulders. Like sometimes I’ll ask her to go see a movie and she’ll curse me. She’s always saying moving pictures are witchcraft and if we watch one we’ll receive eternal damnation. Even though I only suggest buddy comedy movies, she always says it’ll lead to damnation.

You know how girls are always texting? Not her. She doesn’t even have a phone. I asked her for her number and she didn’t have any idea what I meant. And then I showed her my phone so she knew what kind of number I was talking about. She stared at it confused until I turned it on and showed her a funny video of a monkey. Then she got terrified. Yep, she doesn’t think phones or monkeys are cool like the other girls. Amazing, right?

And she’s got such a classy way of speaking. She says words like “doth.” And when she says the word old you just know there’s an “e” at the end. Also you can tell that when she says the word gray she spells it “grey.” You just know a girl is classy when she uses e’s like that.

Sometimes I try to talk to her after class. Most girls you can just talk to and hold a normal conversation with. But not her. She’s different. She always has this concerned look on her face and asks me what year it is and says how she doesn’t belong here. Man, that gets me going.

I was thinking about asking her to the dance. I don’t know if she’d say yes though. “Dancing is of the devil, and God hath punished me enough by having sent me to the future. I needn’t any more trials to face in this life.” She’s always saying that when I ask her to dances.

So for now, I’ll just keep talking to her. I could listen to her talk all day. And sometimes I do. She’s always out yelling things in the middle of campus (or the “village square,” as she calls it). She says things like “I’m so confused, please help me” and “I’m not from this time. I’m a woman from Elizabethan England who fell into a strange glowing hole and was somehow transported through time.”

Elizabethan England. She has such an old soul.
