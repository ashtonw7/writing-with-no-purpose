— Welcome to our monastery. You’re interested in becoming a monk?

— Yep. It seems like the next logical step.

— And why’s that?

— Nothing better to do.

— And you know this is a serious ordeal? It’s a big sacrifice.

— How so?

— For starters, you’ll have to give up all your worldly possessions.

— Even my luchador mask?

— Yes.

— But maybe I could be a wrestling monk. Did you consider that?

— You have to give up the luchador mask.

— Alright. What else do I have to do?

— We meditate for three hours a day. During that time, we take a vow of silence.

— Can I take a vow of rambling instead? People like it when I ramble.

— No.

— I see you all shaved your heads in a ring. Could I do a mohawk instead?

— What purpose would the mohawk serve you?

— I guess my primary goal would be pride. So I could look in the mirror and see how much cooler I am than the other monks. Or maybe that’s vanity? I guess I’d do the mohawk for a mix of pride and vanity.

— You cannot have a mohawk.

— It sounds like a lot of rules. But I bet it’s worth it. Pays pretty well?

— There’s no pay. You’ll have to take a vow of poverty.

— So if I hit it big on a five-dollar scratchie, I can’t cash it in?

— You cannot.

— Alright. So what’s the woman situation here? Do you ever have mixers with the lady monks?

— There are no lady monks. And you’ll have to take a vow of chastity.

— Who’s Chastity? She sounds hot.

— There are a lot of other vows you’ll have to take as well.

— And do I have to abide by them?

— Yes.

— If I become a monk, how soon will I get some of those robes?

— You would get the robes on your first day.

— And do you need underwear beneath the robes?

— Yes.

— But you wouldn’t be able to tell if I wasn’t wearing any, right?  Hey, here's another question. If I got angry at another monk, would I be allowed to hit him on his bald head with my staff?

— We do not condone violence.

— But do you condemn it?

— Do you have any other questions?

— What kind of monastery is this anyway?

— It’s non-denominational.

— What? I thought the sign said dominational. So you aren’t trying to take over the world?

— No.

— Not even the county?

— No.

— Then what are we even here for?

— To find inner peace.

— Man, you sure have a lot of ornate statues around here.

— We do. Each one represents a figure that we could all learn from.

— Do they ever come to life?

— What?

— Like with some sort of monk voodoo.

— We don’t do voodoo.

— Not even a little? I could teach you.

— We do not want to do voodoo.

— Say, what’s all this smoke everywhere?

— That would be the incense.

— Does it get you high or something?

— We are not permitted to do drugs.

— But can you sell drugs? I have a side gig I’d like to keep going.

— You aren’t allowed to have a side gig. Especially one so immoral.

— What if I have a side gig that isn’t immoral so much as amoral?  Sort of morally ambiguous.

— Such as?

— Being a ruthless pimp.

— That is immoral.

— Tomato, tomahto.

— You get one more question.

— Okay fine. What kind of TV do you have here? HBO? Netflix? Hulu?

— We do not have any streaming services.

— Not even Tubi?

— I think it’s best that you leave.

— Can I at least hit the gong on the way out?
